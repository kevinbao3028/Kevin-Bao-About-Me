## 
👋 Hi, I’m Kevin Bao!

🎓 About Me:
I'm a recent Electrical Engineering graduate from UC Davis with a strong foundation in FPGA design, embedded systems, and hardware-software integration. My passion lies in developing innovative hardware solutions, and I enjoy building and optimizing everything from custom floating-point arithmetic units to real-time 3D depth mapping applications.

💻 Technical Skills:
- Languages: Verilog, SystemVerilog, C, MATLAB, Python, RISC-V, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- Developer Tools: Vivado, Intel Quartus Prime, ModelSim, Cadence, LT Spice, OrCad Capture, Simulink
- Hardware: Intel DE-10 FPGA, TI MSP432, Microcontrollers, Oscilloscope, Multimeter

🚀 Projects:
- Real-Time 3D Depth Mapping with FPGA: Built a stereo vision system using Verilog on an Intel DE-10 FPGA, implementing directional regularization and image processing algorithms for enhanced depth estimation.
- Custom Floating Point Arithmetic: Designed and optimized custom floating-point operations in Verilog for accelerated matrix multiplication, with a focus on memory and clock efficiency.
- Custom Memory Allocator: Developed a C-based memory allocator, reducing allocation overhead by 17% and implementing block coalescing for optimized memory management.

🌱 Currently Exploring:
I'm diving deeper into SystemVerilog and UVM for ASIC/RTL design, and I’m working on expanding my knowledge of load balancers and Kubernetes for hardware-oriented applications.
